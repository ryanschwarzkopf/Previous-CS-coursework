   *   certain number of bears. The number of bears is called
   *   <CODE>initial</CODE>, and your goal is to end up with a particular
   *   number of bears, called the <CODE>goal</CODE> number. At any point in 
   *   the game you have two choices: (a) You can ask for (and receive) 
   *   <CODE>increment</CODE> more bears, or (b) if you have an even number of
   *   bears, then you may give half of them back to your friend. Each time you
   *   do (a) or (b), that is called a step in the game. The return value is
   *   true if and only if the goal can be reached in <CODE>n</CODE> steps
