   // This is a method to simulate traffic flowing through two synchronized
   // traffic lights.
   // Parameters and return value:
   // Offset:
   //   This is the number of seconds between the time that the
   //   first light changes to green and the time that the second light changes to
   //   green. For example, if offset is zero, then the two lights change to green
   //   at the same time. If offset is 10 then the first light changes to green
   //   10 seconds ahead of the second.
   // Span:
   //   This is the length of time that each light stays red or green. For
   //   example, if span is 30, then each light stays red for 30 seconds then
   //   switches to green for 30 seconds, and so on.
   // ArrivalProb:
   //   This is the probability during any given second that a car arrives at
   //   the first traffic light. For example, if arrival_prob is 0.25, then there
   //   is a 25% chance that a car arrives at the first light during any given
   //   second and a 75% chance that no car arrives. (There will never be more
   //   than one car arriving during a single second.)
   // TravelTime:
   //   This is the number of seconds that it takes a car to travel from the
   //   first traffic light to the second.
   // TotalTime:
   //   This is the total number of seconds that the method will simulate
   //   at the traffic lights. (At the start of this simulation, there are no
   //   cars waiting at either light).
   // Computation and Return value:
   //   The method simulates cars arriving at the first stop light, waiting
   //   for a green light, moving to the second stoplight, waiting again, and
   //   moving through the second light. During a green light, at most one car
   //   can move through the the light per second. As the computation proceeds,
   //   the method uses an Averager to keep track of the average waiting time
   //   for cars that arrived and pass through the first light. A second
   //   Averager keeps track of the average waiting time for cars that arrived
   //   and passed through the second light. The method's return value is the
   //   sum of these two averages.
   // Special Case:
   //   If no cars make it through the second light, then the return value is -1.

      /*
      -- Student must implement the body of this method. The method should
      -- use two Queues--one for the cars waiting at each stoplight. Each
      -- Queue contains the arrival times of cars that are waiting to go
      -- through the light. The method should have just one BooleanSource
      -- to determine when new cars arrive at the first light. There should
      -- also be two TrafficLight objects and two Averager objects.
