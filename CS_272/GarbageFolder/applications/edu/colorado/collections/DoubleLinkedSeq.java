/******************************************************************************
* This class is a homework assignment;
* A <CODE>DoubleLinkedSeq</CODE> is a collection of <CODE>double</CODE> numbers.
* The sequence can have a special "current element," which is specified and 
* accessed through four methods that are not available in the sequence class 
* (start, getCurrent, advance and isCurrent).
*
* <b>Limitations:</b>
*   Beyond <CODE>Int.MAX_VALUE</CODE> elements, the <CODE>size</CODE> method
*   does not work.
*
* <b>Note:</b>
*   This file contains only blank implementations ("stubs")
*   because this is a Programming Project for my students.
