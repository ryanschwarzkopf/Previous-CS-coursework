<h2> Student Name: Fill this in </h2>
 

<h2> Date: Fill this in </h2>


<h3> Purpose of Lab </h3>

<p> Write a few sentences describing, in your own words, the purpose of the lab. For example, describe informally the problem the program(s) had to solve. By no means should you copy any text from the lab description. That is plagiarism! </p>

 

<h3> Description of Solution(s) </h3>

<p> Write one paragraph for each program the lab required you to create. Describe the general approach used in the program to solve the problem. Describe how you broke the problem down, if needed. Describe any neat insights or tricks used to make a more efficient solution. </p>

 

<h3> Test Results </h3>

<p> Write one paragraph for each program describing how you tested it. For simple programs you can say the actual inputs used, but for more complex programs, give a general description of each test. Describe any bugs found during testing, or state that no bugs were found. </p>

 

<h3> Answers to Questions </h3>

<p> If the lab has questions on it, answer them here. Use one paragraph for each answer (the HTML <p> tag). </p>

 

<h3> Discussion </h3>

<p> Write a paragraph discussing the lab, in particular what you learned in the lab, how easy or hard it was, how well you liked it or disliked it, and any suggestions for making it better.</p>

 

<h3> Contribution to Team Work </h3>

<p> If this is a team lab, please describe the following when applicable: whether you designed the software on paper before coding, what part of coding is done by you (point out file name and line numbers), what bugs you have fixed, what hardware setup you have done, and any other work that consumed substantial thinking and time.</p>

<h3> References </h3>

<p> Document any sources you used in completing the lab, outside of the normal course material (website, textbook, manuals). Perhaps you found an algorithm on the web or some other insight somewhere else? </p>
